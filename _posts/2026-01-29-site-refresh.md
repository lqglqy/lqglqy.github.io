Today I refreshed my GitHub Pages site with a few small but meaningful improvements:

- **Name + identity:** updated the site title to **Victor**.
- **Bio:** changed the tagline to **Software Engineer**.
- **Styling:** refreshed the accent color and softened the UI with rounder cards for a cleaner, more modern look.

Next up, I’ll keep iterating on the layout and add a couple of project pages beyond the current Tetris experiment.
