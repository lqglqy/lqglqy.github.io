Hi, I’m **Victor** — a **Software Engineer**.

This site is my little corner for:
- write-ups on systems/security/infra things I’m learning
- small projects and experiments (like the Tetris page)
- occasional updates when I change/improve the site

If there’s something you want to discuss or collaborate on, feel free to reach me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
